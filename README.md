# Hangman
This is the classic Hangman game build in Ruby for the command-line

## Problems
Build a command-line version of the Hangman game where the computer will randomly choose a word and the user can guess. Show correct letters and end the game where appropriate. Allow saving and loading from file

## What I used
Mixins, JSON, serialization

## What I learned
How to write a game state to a file and load it from file to save and resume a game
